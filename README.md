# Tools for online mapping

Sam Maurer
Guest presentation for UC Berkeley CP 255 - Urban Informatics  
November 2, 2015

Moving beyond CartoDB, this demo will introduce you to other tools for creating interactive online maps. First we'll go over the common design components that these maps share, and compare some tools and technologies for creating them. Then we'll try designing our own base maps and vector tile overlays, adding them to a webpage using the Leaflet Javascript library.
